# Project-1
Hello and welcome to our new Jogging Application called Lets Run!

We aim to provide an all in one jogging application where you can view your route, local weather, and possible music choices all within the same app!

User Story
As a runner I want an application to provide me with all necessary information in one place.
When I open the application, 
I am greeted with a start page.
When I click 'Lets Run', 
I am then sent to the main page of the application.
When I arrive on the main page I am asked to allow my location,
I then see my current coordinates.
When I click 'plan your route',
I am then presented with a google map overlay centered and markered at my current location.
When I click 'check the weather',
I am then presented with my current locations weather conditions.
When I click 'search artist',
I am then presented with a link to my prefered artist top songs.

Thanks for using our app!
